# Financial Data Analysis With Python

### A 2h Full Online Video course

- [Course page](https://www.learnpythonwithrune.org/start-python-with-pandas-for-financial-analysis/)
- [YouTube course playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvMRWNpDTNwQF6t_Tq7aVX0AI6H1avSpv)

### How this works

There are two options

1. Download all Notebooks, follow the course and execute code on your local computer.
2. Follow along using Google colab

Note: On each of those options, you'll find:

- A starter folder, which contains all the notebooks, that are empty in order to follow along.
- A final folder, which contains all the notebooks with all the source code.

### Option 1

- You need Anaconda (with Jupyter Notebook and Python) installed (instructions on course page)
- Follow the YouTube playlist [YouTube course playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvMRWNpDTNwQF6t_Tq7aVX0AI6H1avSpv)
- Go to [Jupyter Notebooks Folder](https://github.com/LearnPythonWithRune/FinancialDataAnalysisWithPython/tree/main/jupyter)

### Option 2

- No installations needed

- Follow the YouTube playlist [YouTube course playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvMRWNpDTNwQF6t_Tq7aVX0AI6H1avSpv)
- Go to [Colab Notebooks Folder](https://github.com/LearnPythonWithRune/FinancialDataAnalysisWithPython/tree/main/colab)

- Note: On each notebook, click on "Open in Colab", in order to open it on Google Colab
